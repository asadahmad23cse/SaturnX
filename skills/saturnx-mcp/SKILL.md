# SaturnX MCP

Use SaturnX as a staged security workflow, not as a bag of unrelated commands.

## Establish authorization and scope

1. Confirm the target, permitted techniques, and stopping conditions before active work.
2. Treat an unconfigured target policy as permissive compatibility behavior, not authorization.
3. Start with passive or low-impact discovery. Escalate only when the request and evidence justify it.
4. Never use installation checks to scan, exploit, navigate to, or verify egress through an external target.
5. Keep secrets out of narration and tool-call summaries. SaturnX redacts common secrets, but avoid echoing them.

## Select the smallest effective tool

- Prefer a structured SaturnX tool. Use `shell_exec` only when the typed surface cannot express the operation.
- Check the tools currently exposed before planning. Optional capabilities may be uninstalled or independently hidden; do not invent a missing tool or assume its binary exists. Use an available structured alternative. Use the administrator escape hatch only when the necessary backend is installed and the raw operation is authorized.
- Use `network_curl` for deterministic HTTP requests. Use browser tools when JavaScript, authentication state, DOM interaction, or visual evidence matters.
- Use installed Nmap scripts or Nuclei templates before authoring custom content.
- Use foreground calls for bounded work. Use `shell_exec_background` plus `shell_check_job` for long-running commands.
- Preserve useful evidence. Follow `raw_artifact`, `stdout_artifact`, or `stderr_artifact` paths when output is filtered or truncated.
- Treat `shell_exec`, `browser_cmd`, and raw `extra_args` as administrator escape hatches outside structured-target guarantees.

Read [tool-routing.md](references/tool-routing.md) before choosing among unfamiliar tools or selectors.
Read [parameter-reference.md](references/parameter-reference.md) before repairing a rejected call or using an unfamiliar parameter.

## Follow the operating loop

1. Discover: identify hosts, DNS, services, technologies, and reachable HTTP surfaces.
2. Focus: choose the narrowest relevant scanner, script, template, or browser path.
3. Verify: corroborate findings with a second signal and retain raw evidence when needed.
4. Escalate: exploit, brute-force, generate payloads, or start listeners only when explicitly authorized.
5. Recover: inspect timeout and partial-output fields, manage jobs or sessions, and start a new SaturnX session after generation-bound state is lost.
6. Report: separate observed evidence from inference, note incomplete output, and state what was not tested.

Parallelize independent passive or light probes within advertised concurrency limits. Serialize dependent scans, browser mutations in one session, credential testing, exploitation, and interactive session work. Normalize targets and reuse existing results or artifacts instead of repeating a scan.

## Use advanced workflows deliberately

- For Nmap mode choice, stock NSE selection, or custom Lua, read [nmap-nse.md](references/nmap-nse.md). Before complex custom authoring, also read `resource://agent_skills/nse`.
- For Nuclei tags/templates or custom YAML, read [nuclei.md](references/nuclei.md). Before complex custom authoring, also read `resource://agent_skills/nuclei`.
- For interactive or visual web work, read [browser.md](references/browser.md).
- For Metasploit, payloads, listeners, background jobs, and recovery, read [exploitation-and-sessions.md](references/exploitation-and-sessions.md).
- For workspace selection, paged evidence reads, retention, jobs, artifacts, and recovery, read [workspace-and-evidence.md](references/workspace-and-evidence.md).
- For LinPEAS, WinPEAS, PowerUp, GTFOBins, or LOLBAS selection and handling, read [post-exploitation-resources.md](references/post-exploitation-resources.md).
- For token-efficient execution, output completeness, `include_raw`, artifacts, polling, and result interpretation, read [efficiency-and-output.md](references/efficiency-and-output.md).

## Handle failures truthfully

- Treat `timed_out=true` as a timeout even when partial output exists.
- Check `terminated` before assuming the timed-out process stopped.
- Read artifacts when `output_complete=false`, `output_filtered=true`, filtering occurred, or truncation is reported. `exit_code=0` means the process completed; it does not prove a vulnerability or complete assessment.
- After container recovery or `system_start_new_session`, assume browser daemons, Metasploit clients/channels, and background processes were reset; workspace files persist.
- After `system_stop_container`, call `system_start_new_session` before expecting another tool to recover the container.
